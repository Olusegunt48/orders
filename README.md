# README: Project Documentation

## Overview

This repository contains Python scripts and SQL queries designed for comprehensive data analysis and reporting. The files provide insights into sales trends, revenue growth, and category performance using the `df_orders` dataset. Below, we explain the files included in the project and their purpose.

---

## Files in the Repository

### 1. Python Script

The Python script handles the Extract, Load, and Transform (ELT) process for the `df_orders` dataset. It is responsible for:

- **Data Extraction:**
  - Reading raw data from a CSV file.
  
- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Cleaning and formatting data for analysis.
  - Handling missing values and outliers.

- **Data Loading:**
  - Connecting to a database and loading the preprocessed data into a table named `df_orders` for querying and analysis.

**Key Features:**
- Uses libraries like `pandas` for data manipulation and `SQLAlchemy` for database interaction.
- Ensures data is properly prepared for downstream SQL queries and analysis.

### 2. SQL Queries

This file contains multiple SQL queries used for analyzing sales data. The queries perform the following tasks:

- Identifying the top revenue-generating products.
- Determining the highest-selling products by region.
- Calculating month-over-month sales growth comparisons for 2022 and 2023.
- Finding the best-performing months for each product category.
- Identifying sub-categories with the highest profit growth.

**Dataset Used:**
The `df_orders` dataset, which includes fields such as:
  - `region`: The region where the sale occurred.
  - `product_ID`: Identifier for the product.
  - `category` and `sub_category`: Categorization of the products.
  - `sale_price`: The selling price of products.
  - `profit`: Profit generated per product.
  - `order_date`: The date of the order.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **SQL Environment:**
   - Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, or PostgreSQL for executing SQL queries.

2. **Python Environment:**
   - Python 3.7 or later with the following packages installed:
     - `pandas`
     - `sqlalchemy`

3. **Dataset Access:**
   - Ensure the `df_orders` dataset is available in the database or as a CSV file for analysis.

---

## How to Use

1. **Python Script:**
   - Ensure the required Python libraries are installed.
   - Update the script with your database connection details.
   - Run the script to extract, preprocess, and load data into the database.

2. **SQL Queries:**
   - Load the preprocessed `df_orders` dataset into your SQL environment.
   - Execute the queries sequentially to derive insights and generate reports.

---

## Recommendations for Scaling

- Use indexing on frequently queried fields like `order_date`, `region`, and `product_ID` to improve SQL performance.
- Leverage cloud databases for handling large datasets and integrating real-time data analysis.
- Modularize the Python script for better maintainability and scalability.
